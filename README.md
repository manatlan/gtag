**gtag** is DEPRECATED, not maintained any more ...

See [HTAG](https://pypi.org/project/htag/), it's the descendant : it's basically the same concepts:
 * Not tied to [guy](https://github.com/manatlan/guy)
 * Able to be used in anything which can display html/js/css (pywebview, cefpython3, a browser, .... or guy)
 * **A lot lot lot better and simpler** (better abstractions/code/concepts)
 * "intelligent rendering" (redraw only component with states changes)

Migrating components should be easy
