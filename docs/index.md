# GTag

**GTag** is a GUI toolkit for building beautiful (components based) applications for desktop, web, and mobile(android) from a single python3 codebase.

[GTag](https://github.com/manatlan/gtag) is a [guy](https://github.com/manatlan/guy) sub module :
It's pure python3.

It's like [flutter](https://flutter.dev/), [justpy](https://justpy.io/), [remi](https://github.com/dddomodossola/remi), 
[fluent](https://github.com/breitburg/fluent) ... but based on [guy](https://github.com/manatlan/guy),
so it inherits of all guy's features OOTB (working in its own window gui (chrome or cef), working as a
web server, working on all platforms, and can be released as apk/android, or a pypi app)

It's a lot inspired from [vuejs](https://vuejs.org/) concepts (you will find components, lifecycle, own data,
two ways data bindings, computed parts & state (like vuex)), but for python3 only.


At start, it was just a test, a proof of concept. But, while things going working very well,
with a minimal number of (<200) lines : it takes life as a real project, named **gtag** (with unitests 
covering 99% of the code)

**GTag**'s name means "Guy Tag" (or GUI Tag)
